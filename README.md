Classification of  facial expressions from live video.
Images are categorized based on the emotion shown in the facial expressions (happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear).
The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. 
The task was to develop a  emotion detection system based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
